# Campus Image Setup

## Adding the College Campus Image

To display the beautiful SVIT campus in the background:

1. **Place the campus image in the `public/` folder:**
   - File name: `svit-campus.jpg` (or `.JPG`)
   - Location: `public/svit-campus.jpg`

2. **The image will be used:**
   - As a very subtle background in the hero section (3% opacity)
   - As a blurred background element in the association badge
   - Creates a seamless, integrated feel

3. **After adding:**
   - Restart dev server
   - Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)

The campus image adds a premium, institutional feel while maintaining the modern aesthetic!
